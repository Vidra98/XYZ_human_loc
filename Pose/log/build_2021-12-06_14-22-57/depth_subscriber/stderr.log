/data/drame/VENV_open/lib/python3.8/site-packages/setuptools_scm/integration.py:16: RuntimeWarning: 
ERROR: setuptools==44.0.0 is used in combination with setuptools_scm>=6.x

Your build configuration is incomplete and previously worked by accident!


This happens as setuptools is unable to replace itself when a activated build dependency
requires a more recent setuptools version
(it does not respect "setuptools>X" in setup_requires).


setuptools>=31 is required for setup.cfg metadata support
setuptools>=42 is required for pyproject.toml configuration support

Suggested workarounds if applicable:
 - preinstalling build dependencies like setuptools_scm before running setup.py
 - installing setuptools_scm using the system package manager to ensure consistency
 - migrating from the deprecated setup_requires mechanism to pep517/518
   and using a pyproject.toml to declare build dependencies
   which are reliably pre-installed before running the build tools
